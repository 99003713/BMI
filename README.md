## PURPOSE
### Body Mass Index(BMI)
BMI can help determine a person that weather it is unhealthy or healthy weight.</br>
These are the data on which BMI is categorised:</br>
Below 18.5 is underweight.</br>
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is Normal.</br>
Between 25 and 29.9 is an overweight BMI.</br>
### Base Metabolic Ratio(BMR)
Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories required to keep your body functioning at rest.

## **Feasibility Study**

### 1.What 
Main aim of BMI calculator is to calculate the Body Mass Index in order to rate the fitness of an individual.

### 2.Why 
In earlier days, It was quite tough to say whether a person was healthy or not . Hence In order to resolve that issue Adolphe Quetelet came up with BMI.

### 3.Who 
All the users possible can get benefit out of it. They can track their health status accordingly.

### 4.When 
This project mostly requires no post testing procedures. In the initial phase itself developer has to ensure pre testing.

### 5.How 
Developer will need few data that needs to be entered by the user like height ,weight,D.O.B etc.And the program will automatically calculate the BMI and will tell whether person is healthy or not.Along with that It will also suggest ,how much more or less calories to be consumed by an individual in order to be fit.

## Requirements
### 1) HIGH LEVEL
#### BMI Calculator
   BMI can help determine a person that weather it is unhealthy or healthy weight.These are the data on which BMI is categorised:
   Below 18.5 is underweight.
   Between 18.5 and 24.9 is Normal
   Between 25 and 29.9 is an overweight BMI.
   The formula for calculating the BMI, weight is divided by the square of the height. Here the weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.
                                                        BMI=kg/(m)^2
 #### AGE Calculator                                                     
   To fulfil the requirement of finding the age by using the date of birth, this age calculator is made.
 #### BMR Calculator
   Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories required to keep your body functioning at rest. BMR is also known as your body’s metabolism; therefore any increase to your         metabolic weight such as exercise will increase your BMR.

   BMR for Men: 66.47 + (13.75 * weight [kg]) + (5.003 * height [cm]) − (6.755 * age [years])

   BMR for Women: 655.1 + (9.563 * weight [kg]) + (1.85 * height[cm]) − (4.676 * age [years])

### 2) LOW LEVEL
   A)In this project we use GitHub repository to store the project and Visual Studio code for debugging the code.
   Some other tools are used for making the UML diagrams.<BR/>
   B)The CPP programming language is used in this entire project.<BR/>
   C)In this project we use GitHub repository to store the project and Visual Studio code for debugging the code.
     Some other tools are used for making the UML diagrams.
