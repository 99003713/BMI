## PURPOSE
### Body Mass Index(BMI)
BMI can help determine a person that weather it is unhealthy or healthy weight.</br>
These are the data on which BMI is categorised:</br>
Below 18.5 is underweight.</br>
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is Normal.</br>
Between 25 and 29.9 is an overweight BMI.</br>
### Base Metabolic Ratio(BMR)
Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories required to keep your body functioning at rest.

## **Feasibility Study**

### 1.What 
Main aim of BMI calculator is to calculate the Body Mass Index in order to rate the fitness of an individual.

### 2.Why 
In earlier days, It was quite tough to say whether a person was healthy or not . Hence In order to resolve that issue Adolphe Quetelet came up with BMI.

### 3.Who 
All the users possible can get benefit out of it. They can track their health status accordingly.

### 4.When 
This project mostly requires no post testing procedures. In the initial phase itself developer has to ensure pre testing.

### 5.How 
Developer will need few data that needs to be entered by the user like height ,weight,D.O.B etc.And the program will automatically calculate the BMI and will tell whether person is healthy or not.Along with that It will also suggest ,how much more or less calories to be consumed by an individual in order to be fit.
